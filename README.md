# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

* installed faker
  * var faker = require('faker');
    var randomName = faker.name.findName();
    var randomEmail = faker.internet.email();
    var randomCard = faker.helpers.createCard();
    https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/

* updated files in src to display more like what we've been 
  doing in class
  
* installed axios -- but also installed faker as an npm so not
  certain that I will need to also make an api call

* installed react-router-dom and styled-components from SC's 4   
  hour code through

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

Each employee should have:
  * Profile Image

  * Name
  
  * Phone 
  
  * Email 
  
  * Date of Birth

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.

## Below is built into the ReadMe

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
